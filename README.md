# TEST CODE FOR CHEMICAL LABORATORY TESTING BENCH

This code is an implementation of GUI in the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B board applied to the new Testing Bench for the Chemical Laboratory

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

 * Raspberry Pi 2 or older version (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/gpio/README.md)
 * Raspbian OS (https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
 * Python3 installed (usually pre-install)
 * Testing BOX 
 
### Running the code

 * Get the code folder into a "desired_directory"
 * Open console and run:
	
		<cd /home/.../"desired_directory">
		
		<sudo python GUI.py>
		
		
 * Follow the instructions in the console.
 
 //Make sure you have the .txt file is in folder "/home/pi/Desktop/Resources/"
 
	

### Tests

Basic test can be applied to the code since the output is a physical response, thus, the next actions should work as testing.

 * Use the test.txt file in order to check file syntax handler.
 * Use an un-existent .txt file to check the wrong path handler.
 * Generate a Ctl+C interrupt while the code is running to check the interrupt handler.
 * Visual inspection of the correlation between the desired behavior and the real one.
